# üëã Hi there! I'm Eno ‚Äì Business Intelligence Analyst | Data Storyteller

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a data-driven problem solver with a background in petroleum engineering and about 6 years of experience in data document management at GeoLogic Systems. I've worked closely with data developers, automated workflows using Python, and led initiatives that improved reporting, metadata accuracy, and system transitions.

Today, I'm focused on transforming raw data into insights that help businesses make smarter, faster decisions as well as designing data architectures.

## Featured Project

### [Optimizing Product Strategy for CanuckDeals Inc.]([(https://github.com/Eno-The-Analyst/canuckdeals-sales-analysis))
A complete BI case study using over 1 million rows of e-commerce behavior data from Kaggle. I used SQLite + Power BI to uncover:
- How promotional events drove one-time purchases but lowered long-term value
- Why some underperforming categories may hold hidden retention potential
- When customers shop (hint: Sunday wins!)
- And how to fix data quality gaps like ‚ÄúUnknown Category‚Äù

The project includes:
- SQL scripts for data cleaning and transformation
- Star schema modeling in Power BI
- DAX measures for AOV, Avg Sales per Customer, and more
- Strategic recommendations for marketing and inventory
